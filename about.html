			<p class="pos-left">As a child of the internet, I grew up around technology and became increasingly interested in it over time. 
			When I was as young as 6 I was already diving into an array of different video games, poking around my favorite operating system, 
			and causing inadvertant mischief. My interest in computers followed me into middle-school and high-school, where I began developing 
			mods for my favorite video games and creating a new circle of friends by sharing my passion for technology.</p>

			<p class="pos-right"> Eventually, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in programming as an extension of that passion, and eventually
			graduated from Bowling Green State University with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Japanese language. Today, my love for technology
			continues to grow as the world approaches new frontiers in hardware and software development, and it is one of my many dreams to be a part of those 
			crucial advancements.</p>
